# bishx

Full dev lifecycle plugin for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code). Takes you from a raw idea to shipped code through a structured pipeline of AI agents.

```
idea → prompt → plan → tasks → code → test → site audit
```

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bishoni/claude-bishx.git ~/.claude/plugins/bishx
```

Then launch Claude Code with the plugin:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ~/.claude/plugins/bishx
```

Type `/bishx:` to verify commands appear in autocomplete.

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) CLI
- [bd (beads)](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) — local task tracker used for task decomposition and execution

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/bishx:plan <prompt>` | Run 10-actor verification pipeline (up to 10 iterations) to produce a bulletproof implementation plan |
| `/bishx:plan-to-bd-tasks` | Decompose the approved plan into bd tasks (Epic → Feature → Task hierarchy) |
| `/bishx:run` | Execute tasks with multi-agent orchestration (Lead → Dev → 3 Reviewers → QA) |
| `/bishx:run <epic>` | Select a specific epic by name (partial match, e.g. `/bishx:run auth`) |
| `/bishx:test` | Deep system testing: auto-detects stack, discovers components, runs all test types, reports bugs to bd |
| `/bishx:site <url>` | Full website audit — crawls up to 100 pages via cmux browser, analyzes UX/UI, SEO, accessibility, performance, conversion |

## Architecture

The plugin uses [Agent Teams](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/agent-teams) — independent Claude Code sessions that communicate peer-to-peer via `SendMessage` and coordinate through a shared `TaskList`.

### Planning pipeline (10 actors)

```
                                  ┌─ Skeptic (opus)
                                  ├─ TDD Reviewer (sonnet)
Interview → Research → Planner →  ├─ Completeness (sonnet)  → Critic → Dry-Run? ×N
                                  ├─ Integration (sonnet)
                                  ├─ Security* (sonnet)
                                  └─ Performance* (sonnet)
                                    * = conditional
```

Iterates up to 10 times until the Critic scores ≥75% with zero blocking issues (APPROVED) and the Dry-Run Simulator passes. Complexity gate adapts the pipeline: TRIVIAL skips review, SMALL runs lite review, MEDIUM+ runs full parallel review. Each session is stored in a timestamped directory (`.bishx-plan/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM/`) with all iterations preserved for history. The approved plan is saved as `APPROVED_PLAN.md` inside the session directory.

### Execution pipeline

```
Lead → Dev (opus) → 3 Reviewers (sonnet, parallel) → Validate (sonnet) → QA (opus)
```

Lead assigns bd tasks from the board and orchestrates the full cycle:

1. **Dev** (opus) implements the task
2. **Three parallel reviewers** (sonnet) analyze the diff independently:
   - **Bug Reviewer** — correctness, logic errors, syntax, tests
   - **Security Reviewer** — OWASP vulnerabilities, injection, XSS, SSRF, secrets
   - **Compliance Reviewer** — CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md project rules
3. **Per-issue validation** (sonnet) — each CRITICAL/MAJOR finding is independently confirmed or rejected by a sonnet subagent to suppress false positives
4. **QA** (opus) runs acceptance testing

Each reviewer has formal severity definitions (CRITICAL/MAJOR/MINOR/INFO), HIGH SIGNAL filters ("what NOT to flag"), scope discipline (diff-only), and self-validation. Pass/fail is deterministic: zero CRITICAL + zero MAJOR + automated checks pass.

Review approach inspired by the [Anthropic code-review plugin](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/code-review).

Lead performs centralized skill lookup from the skill library before each task, passing relevant skill paths to each agent (≤1500 lines budget per agent).

All teammates (Dev, Reviewers, QA) reason and communicate in English for better analytical quality. Lead communicates with the user in the user's language.

### Site audit

```
/bishx:site https://example.com
```

Autonomous website audit powered by cmux browser. Crawls up to 100 pages and produces a design critique document (not code) with actionable recommendations.

Evaluates through a Human-First lens across five layers:

1. **FOR WHOM** — is the right person being served?
2. **WHAT** — is the right content shown?
3. **HOW** — is the presentation right?
4. **FEELING** — how does the page feel to use?
5. **BEHAVIOR** — how does the site respond?

Audit covers 9 modules: UX design, accessibility, SEO (technical + content), performance, marketing content, brand consistency, information architecture, and conversion optimization.

Use when you need a comprehensive quality review of a live website before launch, after a redesign, or as a periodic health check.

Run modes:
- `full` — Dev → Review → QA (default)
- `dev` — Dev → Review only (faster)
